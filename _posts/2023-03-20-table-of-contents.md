# User Research 

To conduct user research with the objective of understanding the biggest pain points for primary school students in Nepal, you can follow these steps:

1. Define your target population: Clearly identify the students you want to target, such as grade 2 students, students from a specific school, or students from a particular area.
    
2. Determine the research method: Decide on the method you will use to gather information, such as surveys, interviews, focus groups, or observation.
    
3. Develop the survey or interview questions: Based on your objective, create questions that will help you gather the information you need. Make sure the questions are clear, easy to understand, and relevant to the students' experiences.
    
4. Recruit participants: Find a way to reach the students you want to interview or survey. You can do this through their school, through parents, or through community organizations.
    
5. Conduct the research: Administer the survey or conduct the interviews or focus groups, making sure to follow all ethical guidelines.
    
6. Analyze the data: Once you have collected the information, analyze it to identify patterns and trends. Pay particular attention to any recurring themes or pain points that the students mention.
    
7. Report the findings: Prepare a report that summarizes the results of your research, including the key findings, trends, and recommendations for addressing the biggest pain points for primary school students in Nepal.
    

Share the findings: Share the findings with stakeholders, such as teachers, parents, and educational organizations, so that they can use the information to improve the learning experiences of primary school students in Nepal.

# Now I go into detail for each of the above steps:  

## 1. Target Population Sample

When defining a target population sample for a research objective, it is important to consider the following points:

1. Age: What is the age range of the primary school students in Nepal?
    
2. Gender: Are you targeting both male and female students or just one gender?
    
3. Location: Are you targeting students from a specific region or all regions of Nepal?
    
4. Socio-economic status: Are you targeting students from a specific socio-economic background? For kids, it can include factors such as the education level and income of their parents, the neighborhood (urban, suburban, rural, gated(sanchay kosh, deep housing), low-income)Â  they live in, and the resources available to them.
    
5. School type: Are you targeting students from government or private schools or both?
    
6. Level of education: Are you targeting students from specific grades or levels of education?
    
7. Academic performance: Are you targeting students based on their academic skills and abilities? Here are some of the categories based on academic performance: High-achieving, Average-performing, Struggling, At risk students.
    
8. Language proficiency: Are you targeting students who are proficient in both English and Nepali, or just one language?
    
9. Learning style: Are you targeting students with specific learning styles, such as visual or auditory learners?
    
10. Technology usage: Are you targeting students who have access to technology and are comfortable using it for learning purposes?
    
11. Parental involvement: Are you targeting students who have involved parents or guardians who can support their learning?
    

By considering these points, you can define a specific target population sample for your research objective and ensure that you are reaching the right audience for your study.

When considering socio-economic status, it is important to consider the following factors:

1. Income: This includes the household income, as well as the individual income of parents or guardians.
    
2. Education level: This refers to the highest level of education attained by the parents or guardians.
    
3. Occupation: This refers to the type of job held by the parents or guardians, as well as their level of job security and stability.
    
4. Housing type and condition: This refers to the type of dwelling in which the family resides, as well as its overall condition and amenities.
    
5. Family structure: This refers to the composition of the family, including the number of parents, children, and other relatives living together.
    
6. Neighborhood characteristics: This includes the physical and social characteristics of the neighborhood, such as its level of crime, poverty, and access to resources and services.
    
7. Social and cultural values: This refers to the values, beliefs, and attitudes held by the family and community, which can influence the educational and life opportunities of children.

## 2. Research Methods

To determine the research method for your objective of understanding the biggest pain points for primary school students in Nepal, you will need to consider the following factors:

1. Research design: Determine whether you want to conduct qualitative or quantitative research, or a combination of both.
    
2. Sampling method: Decide on the method for selecting your sample of primary school students in Nepal. This can be either a probability or non-probability sampling method.
    
3. Data collection tools: Choose the tools that you will use to collect data, such as surveys, interviews, focus groups, observation, or existing data sources.
    
4. Data analysis methods: Determine the methods you will use to analyze your data, such as statistical analysis, content analysis, or thematic analysis.
    

Based on these factors, you can determine the best research method for your objective. For example, if you want to gather in-depth information about the pain points of primary school students in Nepal, you may choose to conduct qualitative research using methods such as in-depth interviews or focus groups. On the other hand, if you want to gather numerical data about the pain points of a large number of primary school students, you may choose to conduct a survey using a quantitative research method.

The sampling method you choose for your research will depend on your research objectives, target population, and available resources. There are several types of sampling methods that can be used, including:

1. Simple Random Sampling: This is a method where each member of the target population has an equal chance of being selected for the sample. For example, if you want to select 100 students from a population of 1000 students, you can use a random number generator to choose 100 unique numbers that correspond to the students' ID numbers.
    
2. Stratified Sampling: This is a method where the target population is divided into subgroups (strata) based on certain characteristics (such as age, gender, socio-economic status, etc.), and then a sample is selected from each stratum. For example, if you want to study the pain points of primary school students in Nepal, you could divide the target population into subgroups based on their grade level and select a sample from each grade level.
    
3. Cluster Sampling: This is a method where the target population is divided into clusters (such as schools, neighborhoods, or villages), and then a sample of clusters is selected. For example, if you want to study the pain points of primary school students in Nepal, you could divide the target population into clusters based on the geographic region they live in, and then select a sample of schools from each region.
    
4. Convenience Sampling: This is a method where the sample is selected based on convenience or accessibility, rather than random selection. For example, if you want to study the pain points of primary school students in Nepal, you could conduct a survey at a school near your home or office.
    

These are some of the commonly used sampling methods, but the method you choose will depend on your research objectives, resources, and the target population. The available resources can greatly impact the choice of sampling method for a research study. For example, if the resources are limited, such as time, budget, and manpower, then a convenient or a non-probability sampling method may be preferred. On the other hand, if the resources are abundant, then a more rigorous and representative sampling method, such as a random or a stratified sampling method, can be employed.

The research design method for your objective of understanding the biggest pain points for primary school students in Nepal could be a qualitative research design. Qualitative research allows for a deep and rich understanding of a topic and can be useful in exploring and understanding complex experiences, perspectives, and attitudes.

Some examples of qualitative research designs for this objective could include:

Focus Group Discussions (FGD) - This involves gathering a small group of primary school students together and facilitating a discussion on their experiences and challenges in school. This could provide valuable insights into their pain points.

In-Depth Interviews (IDI) - This involves conducting one-on-one interviews with primary school students to explore their experiences, challenges, and perspectives on the issues they face in school. This can provide a more in-depth understanding of their pain points.

Ethnography - This involves conducting observations and participating in the daily activities of primary school students to understand their experiences and perspectives. This can provide a rich and detailed understanding of their pain points.

These are just a few examples of qualitative research designs that could be used to understand the biggest pain points for primary school students in Nepal. The exact research design would depend on various factors such as available resources, research objectives, and target population, among others.

For the objective of understanding the biggest pain points for primary school students in Nepal, a qualitative research design, such as interviews or focus groups (need experience), might be more appropriate. This approach would allow researchers to gain in-depth insight into the experiences and perspectives of the students, and to identify the specific challenges and difficulties that they face.
