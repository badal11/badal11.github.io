However, more often than not, slides are not provided when such video lectures are hosted on platforms like YouTube. This project aims to build a robust application that can convert video lectures into corresponding slides using techniques such as basic frame differencing and statistical background subtraction models such as <strong>KNN</strong> or <strong>GMG</strong>.</p> <p>This project converts video frames into slide PDFs. Here’s a step-by-step explanation of how the code works:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Argument Parsing:</strong> <ul> <li>The script uses the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">argparse</code> module to handle command-line arguments. Various parameters, such as the input video path (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">video_path</code>), output directory (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">out_dir</code>), background subtraction type (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">type</code>), hash function (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hash-func</code>), hash size (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hash-size</code>), similarity threshold (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">threshold</code>), queue length (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">queue-len</code>), and flags for post-processing (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">no_post_process</code>) and PDF conversion (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">convert_to_pdf</code>), can be specified.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Argument Validation:</strong> <ul> <li>The script validates certain arguments, such as ensuring that the queue length is positive and handling the case where it’s not. It also checks if the provided video path is a valid URL or an existing file.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Video Download (if URL provided):</strong> <ul> <li>If the provided video path is a URL, the script attempts to download the video using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">download_video</code> function. If successful, it sets a flag (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">temp_file</code>) to indicate that a temporary file was created.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Output Directory Creation:</strong> <ul> <li>The script creates the output directory for storing the resulting slides. The directory is created based on the input video path and the chosen background subtraction type.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Background Subtraction and Slide Capture:</strong> <ul> <li>Depending on the specified background subtraction type, the script calls either <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">capture_slides_frame_diff</code> (for frame differencing) or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">capture_slides_bg_modeling</code> (for Gaussian Mixture Model - GMG or K-Nearest Neighbors - KNN background subtraction).</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Post-Processing (Duplicate Removal):</strong> <ul> <li>If post-processing is not disabled (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">no_post_process</code> is not set), the script performs post-processing using difference hashing to identify and remove duplicate slides.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>PDF Conversion (Optional):</strong> <ul> <li>If the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">convert_to_pdf</code> flag is set, the script converts the captured slides in the output directory to a PDF file using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">convert_slides_to_pdf</code> function.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Temporary File Cleanup (if created):</strong> <ul> <li>If a temporary file was created during video download (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">temp_file</code> is set), it is removed after processing.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>The script utilizes modular functions from other Python files (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config.py</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">download_video.py</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bg_modeling.py</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">frame_differencing.py</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">post_process.py</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">utils.py</code>) for specific tasks like downloading videos, capturing slides, performing background modeling, and post-processing.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Deep_Learning"/><category term="project"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a simple video-to-slide converter application that aims to obtain slide images (or pdf) given slide or lecture videos.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Stock Price forecasting On Nabil Bank</title><link href="https://badal11.github.io/project/2023/stock_price_nabil/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Stock Price forecasting On Nabil Bank"/><published>2023-07-15T13:56:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-07-15T13:56:00+00:00</updated><id>https://badal11.github.io/project/2023/stock_price_nabil</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://badal11.github.io/project/2023/stock_price_nabil/"><![CDATA[ <p>In statistical terms, time series forecasting is the process of analyzing the time series data using statistics and modeling to make predictions and informed strategic decisions. It falls under Quantitative Forecasting. Examples of Time Series Forecasting are weather forecast over next week, forecasting the closing price of a stock each day etc. In this article we will see different types of models which can be used for this analysis and pick what is best for what situations.</p> <p><br/></p> <h2 id="time-series-data">Time series data</h2> <p>Time series data are simply measurements or events that are tracked, monitored, downsampled, and aggregated over time. This could be server metrics, application performance monitoring, network data, sensor data, events, clicks, trades in a market, and many other types of analytics data. We will be taking stock price data to perform our analysis.</p> <p>Nabil bank is a bank located in Nepal, it’s been trading in NEPSE(Nepal Stock Exchange ) for the past 20 years. We can easily get this data by going to the NEPSE website. This data contains four features such as the price of the stock when the market opens on a particular date, the maximum value of the stock, the minimum value, and the value of the stock at which the market close on that day.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/from_other/stock_dataframe.png#center" alt="Image of the data" title="Dataset"/></p> <p><br/></p> <h2 id="preprocessing">Preprocessing</h2> <h3 id="1-normalization">1. Normalization</h3> <p>We need to normalize between 0-1, to remove the problem which arises if the features having in different scales. But when normalizing validate and test data don’t use the validate.max() or text.max() and validate.min() or text.min() for their respective normalization use train.max and train.min for both of them. Because we can’t look at the validate or test dataset they are unknown to us. The important thing to note here is that the normalization has been done on the input feature only not on the label, the model will predict the actual value of stock.</p> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="2-sliding-window">2. Sliding window</h3> <p>To perform Supervised learning the dataset should have inputs and its corresponding label. Data windowing is a popular technique for converting historical data like time series to data suitable for supervised learning. It works as it sounds, we select a window for inputs and feed the model the data which has been selected into that window and the model will try to predict the label for that window. The main features of the input windows are:</p> <p>• The width (number of time steps) of the input and label windows.</p> <p>• The time offset between them.</p> <p>• Which features are used as inputs, labels, or both.</p> <p>Depending on the task and type of model we may want to generate a variety of data windows. Here are some examples:</p> <ol> <li>A model that makes a prediction one hour into the future given six days of history, would need a window like this:</li> </ol> <p><img src="/assets/img/from_other/example1.png#center" alt="Example_1" title="Example 1"/></p> <ol> <li>Similarly, to make a single prediction 24 days into the future, given 24 days of history, we might define a window like this:</li> </ol> <p><img src="/assets/img/from_other/example2.png#center" alt="Example_2" title="Example 1"/></p> <p><a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/">source</a></p> <p>Therefore, depending upon the task and model we can generate varieties of inputs which helps to reduce the redundancy of code as by defining an data window using a class.</p> <p><br/></p> <h2 id="models">Models</h2> <p>In time series forecasting depending upon the number of steps we are going to do the prediction for the models can be classified into two types:</p> <h3 id="1-single-step-model">1. Single step Model</h3> <p>In single step model, model will look one step into the future. For example given all the past one month of stock data model will predict what will be the stock value tomorrow. For this task we will be using models like:</p> <p><br/></p> <h4 id="11-dense-model">1.1 Dense model:</h4> <p>A single dense layer is a single layer of fully connected neural network. Here, we will be sending our Inputs of specific input width into multiple dense layer and finally the output of these dense layer will be send though a single neuron dense layer to produce a single step output. It is an regression problem where we take Open, Close, Low and High as input to predict the closing value of the stock.</p> <p>def dense_func(input_shape): input= tf.keras.Input(shape= tf.constant(input_shape)) x= tf.keras.layers.Flatten()(input)</p> <p>#Basically there are four dense layer each followed by an dropout layer x= tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=556, activation=’relu’)(x) x= tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2)(x)</p> <p>x= tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=228, activation=’relu’)(x) x= tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2)(x)</p> <p>x= tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=128, activation=’relu’)(x) x= tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2)(x)</p> <p>x= tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=64, activation=’relu’)(x) x= tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2)(x)</p> <p>output= tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1)(x) model= tf.keras.Model(inputs= input,outputs= output)<br/> return model</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/from_other/desce_code.png#center," alt="Architecture" title="Architecture"/></p> <h5 id="a-hyperparameter-tuning">a. Hyperparameter tuning</h5> <p>One of the most important hyperparameter for stock price prediction is the number of days that the model sees to make future prediction ie input_width. This hyperparameter value is calculated by training the model on different number of input width and the model which produces lowest loss it is selected.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/from_other/hyperparameter_for_dense_model.png#center" alt="Input width vs Mean square Error(MSE)" title="Input width vs Mean square Error(MSE)"/></p> <p>We trained the model on input width [3,5,8,15,18,22,25,28,31] and among them the minimum value of MSE was obtained with the 3. So, the input width for the dense model is selected as 3.</p> <p><br/></p> <h5 id="b-evaluation">b. Evaluation</h5> <p>At input width 3, the label and prediction for Close value of stock look like this: <img src="/assets/img/from_other/Dense_model_ground_truth_vs_prediction.png#center" alt="label vs prediction" title="label vs prediction"/></p> <p><br/></p> <h4 id="12-lstm-model">1.2 LSTM model</h4> <p>A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a type of neural network well-suited to time series data. RNNs process a time series step-by-step, maintaining an internal state from time step to time step.Let’s see understand how RNN will process time series data:</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/from_other/RNN.png#center" alt="LSTM modelS" title="LSTM model"/></p> <p>Here the RNN/LSTM is trained on every single input step, as a result, it makes the model more robust to changing landscape which is common in the stock dataset. It will take stock prices[Open, Close, High, Low] as input for the first day and predict the Close value for the second day. Similarly, a second time stamp will take the feature vector generated from the first time stamp and second days inputs to predict the 3rd step value and so on until it predicts one step into the future.</p> <p>def lstm_model(input_shape):</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>inp= Input(shape=input_shape) #BATCH,TIMESTAMP,FEATURES

Thus, unlike a single-step model, where only a single future point is predicted, a multi-step model predicts a sequence of the future values. There are two rough approaches to this:</p> <p>2.1. Single-shot Model Single-shot Model makes prediction of the entire time series at once. It is a time machine that can jump to any day into the future.</p> <p>2.2. Autoregressive predictions where the model only makes single-step predictions and its output is fed back as its input. We can see it as a time machine that can’t directly jump to any future date, instead, it had to go through each of the previous dates until it reaches the required future date.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/from_other/autoregressive.png#center" alt="Autoregressive Model" title="Autoregressive Model"/></p> <p>For example, a person is living in 2012 who wants to go to 2022, if he used its single-shot time machine he can directly go to the year 2022 but as the machine doesn’t have any information about the jumped years its prediction events may be different from the actual events. But on the other hand, if he used its autoregressive time machine, the time machine will take him to the year 2013 and then 2014 until he reaches the year 2022, therefore the machine learns information about the intermediate year also which helps to improve the prediction significantly.</p> <p>class denseLayers(tf.keras.layers.Layer): def <strong>init</strong>(self): super().<strong>init</strong>() self.dense1= layers.Dense(256) self.dense2= layers.Dense(128) self.dense3= layers.Dense(32) self.dense4= layers.Dense(1)</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>def call(self,inputs):

It has got two models: the Generator and the Discriminator are put together into a game of adversary. Through which they learn the intricate details of the target data distribution. These two models are playing a MIN-MAX game where one tries to minimize the loss and the other tries to maximize. While doing so a global optimum is reached, where the Discriminator is no longer able to distinguish between real and generated (fake) data distribution.</p> <p>SISR(Single Image Super-Resolution) is an application of GAN. Image super-resolution is the process of enlarging small photos while maintaining a high level of quality, or of restoring high-resolution images from low-resolution photographs with rich information. Here the model’s work is to map the function from low-resolution image data to its high-resolution image. Instead of giving a random noise to the Generator, a low-resolution image is fed into it. After passing through various Convolutional Layers and Upsampling Layers, the Generator gives a high-resolution image output. Generally, there are multiple solutions to this problem, so it’s quite difficult to master the output up to original images in terms of richness and quality.</p> <p><br/></p> <h2 id="data-preprocessing-and-augmentation">Data Preprocessing and Augmentation:</h2> <p>We have used the <a href="https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/">DIV2K</a> [Agustsson and Timofte (2017)] dataset provided by the TensorFlow library. There are altogether 800 pairs of low resolution and high-resolution images in the the training set whereas 100 pairs in the testing set. This data contains mainly people, cities, fauna, sceneries, etc. We used flipping and rotating through 90, 180, and 270 degrees randomly over the dataset. Since we had limited memory on the training computer, we had to split large images into patches of smaller size. 19 patches of size 96 ✕ 96 pixels resolution were obtained from an image randomly. Our generator is designed to upsample images by 4 times so, the output image patch will be of dimension: 384 ✕ 384 pixels.</p> <p><br/></p> <h2 id="generator">Generator</h2> <p>The generator is the block in the architecture which is responsible for generating the high resolution(HR) images from low resolution(LR) images. In 2015, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802">SRGAN</a> was published which introduced the concept of using GAN for SISR tasks which produced the state the art solution. The generator of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802">SRGAN</a> consists of several residual blocks that facilitate the flow of the gradient during backpropagation.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/from_other/generator.png#center" alt="Generator Architecture"/></p> <p>To further enhance the quality of generator images <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00219">ESRGAN</a> was released which performed some modifications in the generator of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802">SRGAN</a> which includes:</p> <ul> <li>Removing the batch normalized(BN) layers.</li> <li>Replacing the original residual block with the proposed Residual-in-Residual Dense Block (RRDB), which combines multi-level residual network and dense connections as in the figure below:</li> </ul> <p><img src="/assets/img/from_other/rrdb.png#center" alt="RRDB Diagram"/></p> <p>Fig: Residual in Residual Dense Block(RRDB)</p> <p>Removing BN layers has proven to increase performance and reduce the computational complexity in different PSNR-oriented tasks including SR and deblurring. BN layers normalize the features using mean and variance in a batch during training and use the estimated mean and variance of the whole training dataset during testing. When the statistics of training and testing datasets differ a lot, BN layers tend to introduce unpleasant artifacts and limit the generalization ability. The researchers empirically observe that BN layers are more likely to bring artifacts when the network is deeper and trained under a GAN framework. These artifacts occasionally appear among iterations and different settings, violating the need for stable performance overtraining. Therefore, removing BN layers for stable training and consistent performance. Furthermore, removing BN layers helps to improve generalization ability and to reduce computational complexity and memory usage.</p> <p>RRDB employs a deeper and more complex structure than the original residual block in SRGAN. Specifically, as shown in the figure above, the proposed RRDB has a residual-in-residual structure, where residual learning is used at different levels. Here, the RRDB uses dense block in the main path, where the network capacity becomes higher benefiting from the dense connections. In addition to the improved architecture, it also exploits several techniques to facilitate training a very deep network such as residual scaling(beta) i.e., scaling down the residuals by multiplying a constant between 0 and 1 before adding them to the main path to prevent instability.</p> <p><br/></p> <h2 id="discriminator">Discriminator</h2> <p>The task of the discriminator is to discriminate between real HR images and generated SR images. Discriminator architecture here used is similar to DC-GAN architecture with LeakyReLU activation function. The network contains eight convolutional layers with 3×3 filter kernels, increasing by a factor of 2 from 64 to 512 kernels as in the VGG network. Strided convolutions are used to reduce the image resolution each time the number of features is doubled. But to overcome the instability while training of original GAN, we use a variant of GANs named improved training of Wasserstein GANs (WGAN-GP). So the last sigmoid layer of the conventional DC-GAN discriminator is omitted. This helps in not restricting the feature maps in 0 to 1 value.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/from_other/discriminator.png#center" alt="discriminator image"/></p> <h2 id="losses">Losses:</h2> <h3 id="generator-loss">Generator Loss</h3> <p>The generator loss is the sum of MSE, perceptual loss +adversarial loss</p> <p><em>l<sub>G</sub> = MSE+Perceptual Loss +Adversarial loss</em></p> <p><em>l<sub>G</sub>= l<sub>MSE</sub>+l<sub>p</sub>+ l<sub>GA</sub></em></p> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="mean-square-errormse">Mean Square Error(MSE)</h3> <p>As the most common optimization objective for SISR, the pixelwise MSE loss is calculated as:</p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>_l<sub>MSE</sub> =</td> <td> </td> <td>G<sub>Θ</sub>(I<sub>LR</sub>) - I<sub>HR</sub></td> <td> </td> <td><sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>_,</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>where the parameter of the generator is denoted by ; the generated image, namely I<sub>SR</sub>,is denoted by G<sub>Θ</sub>(I<sub>LR</sub>); and the ground truth is denoted by I<sub>HR</sub> . Although models with MSE loss favor a high PSNR value, the generated results tend to be perceptually unsatisfying with overly smooth textures. Despite the aforementioned shortcomings, this loss term is still kept because MSE has clear physical meaning and helps to maintain color stability.</p> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="perceptual-loss">Perceptual Loss</h3> <p>To compensate for the shortcomings of MSE loss and allow the loss function to better measure semantic and perceptual differences between images, we define and optimize a perceptual loss based on high-level features extracted from a pretrained network. The rationality of this loss term lies in that the pretrained network for classification originally has learned to encode the semantic and perceptual information that may be measured in the loss function. To enhance the performance of the perceptual loss, a 19-layer VGG network is used. The perceptual loss is actually the Euclidean distance between feature representations, which is defined as</p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>_l<sub>p</sub> =</td> <td> </td> <td>𝜙(G<sub>Θ</sub>(I<sub>LR</sub>)) - 𝜙(I<sub>HR</sub>)</td> <td> </td> <td><sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>_,</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>where 𝜙 refers to the 19-layer VGG network. With this loss term, I<sub>SR</sub> and I<sub>HR</sub> are encouraged to have similar feature representations rather than to exactly match with each other in a pixel wise manner.</p> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="adversarial-losses">Adversarial Losses:</h3> <p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802">SRGAN</a>, the adopted generative model is generative adversarial network (GAN) and it suffers from training instability. WGAN leverages the Wasserstein distance to produce a value function, which has better theoretical properties than the original GAN. However, WGAN requires that the discriminator must lie within the space of 1-Lipschitz through weight clipping, resulting in either vanishing or exploding gradients without careful tuning of the clipping threshold. <br/> To overcome the flaw of clipping , a new approach is applied called Gradient Pelanty method. It is used to enforce the Lipschitz constraint. This way Wasserstein distance between two distributions to help decide when to stop the training but penalizes the gradient of the discriminator with respect to its input instead of weight clipping. With gradient penalty, the discriminator is encouraged to learn smoother decision boundaries.</p> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="generator-loss-1">Generator Loss</h3> <p><em>l<sub>GA</sub>=-𝔼[D(G<sub>Θ</sub>(I<sub>LR</sub>)]</em></p> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="discriminator-loss">Discriminator Loss</h3> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>_l<sub>DA</sub>=𝔼[D(G<sub>Θ</sub>(I<sub>LR</sub>)]-𝔼[D(I<sub>HR</sub>)] + λ𝔼(</td> <td> </td> <td>▽<sub>hat{I}</sub>D(hat{I})-1</td> <td> </td> <td><sub>2</sub>-1)<sup>2</sup>_</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><img src="/assets/img/from_other/work_flow.png#center" alt="workflow diagram"/></p> <p>Normally, the output of the classifier i.e. discriminator in this case is kept between 0-1 using a sigmoid function in the last layer, where if discriminator prediction 0 for an image then the image is SR likewise if the prediction is 1 then it is an HR image.

Target Population Sample</h2> <p>When defining a target population sample for a research objective, it is important to consider the following points:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Age: What is the age range of the primary school students in Nepal?</p> </li> <li> <p>Gender: Are you targeting both male and female students or just one gender?</p> </li> <li> <p>Location: Are you targeting students from a specific region or all regions of Nepal?</p> </li> <li> <p>Socio-economic status: Are you targeting students from a specific socio-economic background? For kids, it can include factors such as the education level and income of their parents, the neighborhood (urban, suburban, rural, gated(sanchay kosh, deep housing), low-income)  they live in, and the resources available to them.</p> </li> <li> <p>School type: Are you targeting students from government or private schools or both?</p> </li> <li> <p>Level of education: Are you targeting students from specific grades or levels of education?</p> </li> <li> <p>Academic performance: Are you targeting students based on their academic skills and abilities? Here are some of the categories based on academic performance: High-achieving, Average-performing, Struggling, At risk students.</p> </li> <li> <p>Language proficiency: Are you targeting students who are proficient in both English and Nepali, or just one language?</p> </li> <li> <p>Learning style: Are you targeting students with specific learning styles, such as visual or auditory learners?</p> </li> <li> <p>Technology usage: Are you targeting students who have access to technology and are comfortable using it for learning purposes?</p> </li> <li> <p>Parental involvement: Are you targeting students who have involved parents or guardians who can support their learning?</p> </li> </ol> <p>By considering these points, you can define a specific target population sample for your research objective and ensure that you are reaching the right audience for your study.</p> <p>When considering socio-economic status, it is important to consider the following factors:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Income: This includes the household income, as well as the individual income of parents or guardians.</p> </li> <li> <p>Education level: This refers to the highest level of education attained by the parents or guardians.</p> </li> <li> <p>Occupation: This refers to the type of job held by the parents or guardians, as well as their level of job security and stability.</p> </li> <li> <p>Housing type and condition: This refers to the type of dwelling in which the family resides, as well as its overall condition and amenities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Family structure: This refers to the composition of the family, including the number of parents, children, and other relatives living together.</p> </li> <li> <p>Neighborhood characteristics: This includes the physical and social characteristics of the neighborhood, such as its level of crime, poverty, and access to resources and services.</p> </li> <li> <p>Social and cultural values: This refers to the values, beliefs, and attitudes held by the family and community, which can influence the educational and life opportunities of children.</p> </li> </ol> <hr/> <hr/> <h2 id="2-research-methods">2. Research Methods</h2> <p>To determine the research method for your objective of understanding the biggest pain points for primary school students in Nepal, you will need to consider the following factors:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Research design: Determine whether you want to conduct qualitative or quantitative research, or a combination of both.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sampling method: Decide on the method for selecting your sample of primary school students in Nepal. This can be either a probability or non-probability sampling method.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data collection tools: Choose the tools that you will use to collect data, such as surveys, interviews, focus groups, observation, or existing data sources.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data analysis methods: Determine the methods you will use to analyze your data, such as statistical analysis, content analysis, or thematic analysis.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Based on these factors, you can determine the best research method for your objective. For example, if you want to gather in-depth information about the pain points of primary school students in Nepal, you may choose to conduct qualitative research using methods such as in-depth interviews or focus groups. On the other hand, if you want to gather numerical data about the pain points of a large number of primary school students, you may choose to conduct a survey using a quantitative research method.</p> <p>The sampling method you choose for your research will depend on your research objectives, target population, and available resources. There are several types of sampling methods that can be used, including:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Simple Random Sampling: This is a method where each member of the target population has an equal chance of being selected for the sample. For example, if you want to select 100 students from a population of 1000 students, you can use a random number generator to choose 100 unique numbers that correspond to the students’ ID numbers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Stratified Sampling: This is a method where the target population is divided into subgroups (strata) based on certain characteristics (such as age, gender, socio-economic status, etc.), and then a sample is selected from each stratum. For example, if you want to study the pain points of primary school students in Nepal, you could divide the target population into subgroups based on their grade level and select a sample from each grade level.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cluster Sampling: This is a method where the target population is divided into clusters (such as schools, neighborhoods, or villages), and then a sample of clusters is selected. For example, if you want to study the pain points of primary school students in Nepal, you could divide the target population into clusters based on the geographic region they live in, and then select a sample of schools from each region.</p> </li> <li> <p>Convenience Sampling: This is a method where the sample is selected based on convenience or accessibility, rather than random selection. For example, if you want to study the pain points of primary school students in Nepal, you could conduct a survey at a school near your home or office.</p> </li> </ol> <p>These are some of the commonly used sampling methods, but the method you choose will depend on your research objectives, resources, and the target population. The available resources can greatly impact the choice of sampling method for a research study. For example, if the resources are limited, such as time, budget, and manpower, then a convenient or a non-probability sampling method may be preferred. On the other hand, if the resources are abundant, then a more rigorous and representative sampling method, such as a random or a stratified sampling method, can be employed.</p> <p>The research design method for your objective of understanding the biggest pain points for primary school students in Nepal could be a qualitative research design. Qualitative research allows for a deep and rich understanding of a topic and can be useful in exploring and understanding complex experiences, perspectives, and attitudes.</p> <p>Some examples of qualitative research designs for this objective could include:</p> <p>Focus Group Discussions (FGD) - This involves gathering a small group of primary school students together and facilitating a discussion on their experiences and challenges in school. This could provide valuable insights into their pain points.</p> <p>In-Depth Interviews (IDI) - This involves conducting one-on-one interviews with primary school students to explore their experiences, challenges, and perspectives on the issues they face in school. This can provide a more in-depth understanding of their pain points.</p> <p>Ethnography - This involves conducting observations and participating in the daily activities of primary school students to understand their experiences and perspectives. This can provide a rich and detailed understanding of their pain points.</p> <p>These are just a few examples of qualitative research designs that could be used to understand the biggest pain points for primary school students in Nepal. The exact research design would depend on various factors such as available resources, research objectives, and target population, among others.</p> <p>For the objective of understanding the biggest pain points for primary school students in Nepal, a qualitative research design, such as interviews or focus groups (need experience), might be more appropriate. This approach would allow researchers to gain in-depth insight into the experiences and perspectives of the students, and to identify the specific challenges and difficulties that they face.</p> <hr/> <hr/> <h2 id="3-interview">3.
