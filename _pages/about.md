Computer Engineer 

Hello, Iâ€™m Badal Tripathi, a Computer Engineering graduate from the Institute of Engineering, Pashchimanchal Campus, Tribhuvan University,2022. Currently, I am working as an Laravel Developer/AI Engineer at TriCode Technology. In this role, I engage in diverse responsibilities such as data preprocessing, integration of machine learning models into IoT systems for predictive analytics, anomaly
detection, decision-making, and also do some NLP projects. Prior to my current role, I was a laravel developer. 
<br/><br/> 
I'm passionate about discovering creative ways to improve education. I've also done a research on challenges faced by primary school students in Nepal. [Here is the link to the article](/project/2022/Nepali-Student's-Insights). 
<!-- <br/><br/> 
Right now, I'm looking for opportunities to study Machine Learning, specifically NLP in graduate schools. I'm curious and excited to contribute to these fields and eager to join graduate programs to learn more and be part of the ML/AI community.
